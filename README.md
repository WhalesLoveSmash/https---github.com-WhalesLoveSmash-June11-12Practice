# 👻 Ghost Kitchen

welcome to **Ghost Kitchen**, a haunted fake restaurant where you can’t eat anything but can definitely get jump scared by how good the code structure is.

specials include:
- 🧠 *PolterGeist Pizza*
- 💨 *Whailing Banshee Burger*
- 🔪 *The Haunted Chef*

this is **not** a real restaurant. this is a solo-coded project built to learn fullstack web dev with good vibes and spooky aesthetics.

## 🔥 what it actually is

a **JSON-powered**, mobile-first restaurant site built from scratch using:
- no frameworks
- no templates
- no code I don’t fully understand

everything’s written by hand. everything’s deployed through **GitHub Pages**.  
I’m using **Tailwind via CDN** and plain JavaScript — no React, no bundlers.

---

## ✨ mvp features (done or doing right now)

- dynamic menu powered by JSON (no hardcoded items)
- spooky theme + ghost-based specials
- mobile-first layout with hamburger nav
- fake order confirmation UI
- auto dark mode (based on device theme)
- instant GitHub Pages deploy on every push

---

## 🧠 coming soon (aka backend phase)

- Node.js backend hosted on Replit or similar
- custom API to take + store orders
- optional Stripe integration
- optional email confirmations
- potentially cursed meal tracking system 👁️

## 💾 tech stack

| layer     | tech                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| frontend  | HTML + Tailwind (CDN) + Vanilla JS |
| backend   | Node.js (later)                    |
| hosting   | GitHub Pages (frontend), Replit API |

---

## 🚀 deployment plan

- frontend → GitHub Pages (auto-updates on commit)
- backend → Replit (or Glitch, or whatever works free)

---

## 🧪 goal / style / vibe

this project is about **actually learning** not just vibe coding  
phase 1: barebones frontend MVP  
phase 2: backend core logic  
phase 3: make it actually look cool  

no copy-pastes. everything handtyped.  
UI will glow up later. right now we’re shipping skeletons.
