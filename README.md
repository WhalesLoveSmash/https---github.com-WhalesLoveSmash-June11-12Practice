# 👻 Ghost Kitchen

Welcome to **Ghost Kitchen**, a haunted fake restaurant where you can’t eat anything but can definitely get jump scared by how good the code structure is.

Specials include:  
- 🧠 *PolterGeist Pizza*  
- 💨 *Whailing Banshee Burger*  
- 🔪 *The Haunted Chef*

This is **not** a real restaurant. It’s a solo-coded project built to learn fullstack web development with good vibes and spooky aesthetics.

## 🔥 What it actually is

A **JSON-powered**, mobile-first restaurant site built from scratch using:  
- no frameworks  
- no templates  
- no code that isn’t fully understood

Everything’s written by hand and deployed through **GitHub Pages**.  
It uses **Tailwind via CDN** and plain JavaScript — no React, no bundlers.

## ✨ MVP Features

- Dynamic menu powered by JSON (no hardcoded items)  
- Spooky theme + ghost-based specials  
- Mobile-first layout with hamburger nav  
- Fake order confirmation UI  
- Auto dark mode (based on device theme)  
- Instant GitHub Pages deploy on every push  

---

## 🧠 Coming soon (backend phase)

- Node.js backend hosted on Replit or similar  
- Custom API to accept and store orders  
- Optional Stripe integration  
- Optional email confirmations  
- Potentially cursed meal tracking system 👁️

## 🧪 Goal / Style / Vibe

This project is about **actually learning** — not just vibe coding.  
Phase 1: Barebones frontend MVP (complete)  
Phase 2: Backend core logic (in progress)  
Phase 3: UI polish and style improvements (upcoming)  

No copy-pastes. Everything handtyped.  
UI will get a glow-up later — right now it’s a working skeleton.
